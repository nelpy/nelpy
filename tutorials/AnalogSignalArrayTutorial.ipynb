    "The `AnalogSignalArray` is used to store fairly-regularly-sampled temporal signals. Ideally the signals should be sampled regularly, but many of the methods handle irregularly sampled data gracefully, and moreover, the `AnalogSignalArray` makes it easy to sanitize an irregularly sampled signal into an easier-to-work-with regularly sampled signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, an `AnalogSignalArray` contains a `.time` attribute, and a `.data` attribute, corresponding to the (n,) sample timestamps, in seconds, and the (m, n) signal values (n samples for each of m signals).\n",

    "\n",
    "## AnalogSignalArray (m-D)\n",
    "\n",
    "An `AnalogSignalArray` represents a multi-dimensional analog signal function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^m \\quad \\bigl(t \\mapsto (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m)\\bigr)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The default domain is $\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}$, and the support can either be specified or inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "If a support is specified as a collection of intervals $\\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_k\\}$, then the AnalogSignalArray behaves like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f: \\mathbb{S} \\to \\mathbb{R}^m \\quad \\bigl(t \\mapsto (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m)\\bigr)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{S} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k s_i$, so that the AnalogSignalArray is **undefined** in $\\Omega \\backslash \\mathbb{S}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal Data Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "An `AnalogSignalArray` contains `data` and `time` attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data` $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ where $m$ is the number of signals and $n$ is the number of samples\n",
    "- `time` is a numpy vector (1-dimensional array) with shape $(n,)$, containing the sample times in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the `data` matrix itself (as a numpy array, not a nelpy object), it's convenient to iterate over signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for signal in data:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, plotting with matplotlib directly can be inconvenient since matplotlib plots each **column** of a matrix as a single trace. To plot `data` with matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "plt.plot(data.T)  # plot each signal as a single continuous trace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! warning \"Discontinuities\"\n",
    "    This approach ignores the fact that signals are not always continuous. Nelpy considers each signal to be composed of different segments, each assumed to be continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nelpy Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nelpy provides plotting as an almost drop-in replacement for matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nelpy.plotting as npl\n",
    "npl.plot(asa)  # plot each signal as a single trace, respecting discontinuities\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating an `AnalogSignalArray` with multiple segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import nelpy as nel\n",
    "\n",
    "t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "y1 = t**3\n",
    "y2 = 3*t**2\n",
    "y3 = 6*t\n",
    "y4 = 6*np.ones(t.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "asa = nel.AnalogSignalArray(\n",
    "    np.vstack((y1, y2, y3, y4)), \n",
    "    timestamps=t, \n",
    "    support=nel.EpochArray([[0,3], [5,10]])\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an `AnalogSignalArray` with four signals and two snippets/segments/epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Epoch Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access timestamps and signal data using `asa.time` and `asa.data`, but these don't directly indicate which samples are contiguous. For better handling of discontinuities, use the `_epochtime` and `_epochdata` special objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot each snippet separately to preserve discontinuities\n",
    "for timestamps, data in zip(asa._epochtime, asa._epochdata):\n",
    "    plt.plot(timestamps, data.T)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! tip \"Better Plotting\"\n",
    "    While this preserves discontinuities, signal snippets will have different colors, making it difficult to see which segments correspond to which signals. Using `npl.plot(asa)` handles this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration over an `AnalogSignalArray` (and most core temporal nelpy objects) iterates over the continuous epochs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for snippet in asa:\n",
    "    # snippet is an AnalogSignalArray with only a single underlying support epoch\n",
    "    timestamps, data = (snippet.time, snippet.data)  # one continuous epoch at a time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Restriction\n",
    "\n",
    "`AnalogSignalArray`s can be indexed/restricted using `EpochArray`s. The resulting `AnalogSignalArray` will be defined on the intersection of its own underlying support and the requested `EpochArray`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ep = nel.EpochArray([2, 7])\n",
    "asa_new = asa[ep]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `asa` had a support of $[0, 3) \\cup [5, 10)$, then `asa_new` will be defined on $[2, 3) \\cup [5, 7)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Epoch Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can index epochs with integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "asa[0]  # asa restricted to first epoch\n",
    "asa[1]  # asa restricted to second epoch\n",
    "asa[2]  # empty AnalogSignalArray (no third epoch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signal Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended syntax allows access to individual signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "asa[0, 0]     # first epoch, first signal\n",
    "asa[0, 1]     # first epoch, second signal\n",
    "asa[:, 2:]    # all epochs, third and fourth signals\n",
    "asa[:, [1,3]] # all epochs, second and fourth signals\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info \"Future Enhancement\"\n",
    "    Eventually, sample indexing will be supported with the form `asa[epoch, signal, sample]`. This indexing form is consistent across most nelpy objects (e.g., `SpikeTrainArray` uses `sta[epoch, unit, ...]`).\n",
