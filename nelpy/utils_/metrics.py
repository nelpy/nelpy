    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array-like
        Array or matrix on which to compute the Gini coefficient(s).
    mode : string, optional
        One of ['row-wise', 'col-wise', 'all']. Default is 'all'.

    Note
    ----
    If arr is a transition matrix A, such that Aij = P(S_k=j|S_{k-1}=i),
    then 'row-wise' is equivalent to 'tmat_departure' and 'col-wise' is
    equivalent to 'tmat_arrival'.

    Similarly, if arr is the observation (lambda) matrix of an HMM such that
    lambda \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n_states \\times n_units}, then 'row-wise' is
    equivalent to 'lambda_across_units' and 'col-wise' is equivalent to
    'lambda_across_units'.

    array before computing the Gini coefficient.

    Additional information
    ----------------------

    This function was written by Olivia Guest (https://github.com/oliviaguest/gini).

    See https://www.statsdirect.com/help/default.htm#nonparametric_methods/gini.htm

    The classical definition of G appears in the notation of the theory of
    relative mean difference:

    .. math::
        G = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n |x_i - x_j|}{2n^2\\bar{x}}
    where x is an observed value, n is the number of values observed and
    x bar is the mean value.

    If the x values are first placed in ascending order, such that each x
    has rank i, the some of the comparisons above can be avoided and
    computation is quicker:

    .. math::
        G = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n(2i-n-1)x_i}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}

    where x is an observed value, n is the number of values observed and i
    is the rank of values in ascending order.

    Note that only positive non-zero values are used.

    Examples
    --------
    For a very unequal sample, 999 zeros and a single one,

    .. code-block:: python
        a = np.zeros((1000))
        a[0] = 1.0
    the Gini coefficient is very close to 1.0:
    .. code-block:: python
        gini(a)
        0.99890010998900103

    For uniformly distributed random numbers, it will be low, around 0.33:

    .. code-block:: python
        s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)
        gini(s)
    0.3295183767105907

    For a homogeneous sample, the Gini coefficient is 0.0:
    .. code-block:: python
        b = np.ones((1000))
        gini(b)
    0.0
